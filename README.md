# Raiden
## Introduction
This is the midterm project of the curese Software Studio. Our goal is to create a retro version of Raiden, which is an easy shooting game where the player operates an aircraft to eliminate enemies.

> All the icons in the game are drawn by myself and opened to download. Please refer the the "image" directory.
